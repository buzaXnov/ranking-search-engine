EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \\nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \\npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \\nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \\nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \\nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \\nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \\nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \\nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \\nsystem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \\nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \\nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \\nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \\nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \\ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \\nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \\nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \\nalso.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \\nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \\nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \\nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \\nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \\nat this time.  It's great to have you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \\nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \\nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \\nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \\ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \\nfrom school to the work place.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \\nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \\neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \\nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \\nmake things happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \\nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \\nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \\nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \\nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \\nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \\nthe rest of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \\nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \\nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \\nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \\neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \\nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \\nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \\nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \\ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \\nwith changing times.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \\nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \\ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \\nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \\ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \\nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \\nlong run.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \\nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \\nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \\nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \\nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \\nlearn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \\nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \\nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \\nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \\ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \\nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \\nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \\ncan be learning and working at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \\nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \\ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \\ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \\ncan prepare students for this world of work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \\nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \\nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \\nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \\nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \\njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \\nareas of the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \\nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \\nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \\nwords is that so important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \\nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \\nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \\nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \\ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \\nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \\nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \\nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \\nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \\ntaught before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \\nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \\nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \\nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \\nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \\ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \\nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \\ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \\ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \\nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \\neducational component of training.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \\nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \\nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \\neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \\nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \\ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \\nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \\napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \\nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \\neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \\nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \\nyoung people even beyond the summer.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \\nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \\nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \\ndeveloping.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \\nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \\nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \\nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \\nget in a high school diploma.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \\nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \\neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \\npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \\ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \\nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \\nemployers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \\ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \\nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \\ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \\nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \\nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \\nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \\nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \\na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \\nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \\nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \\nthe earnings of American workers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \\nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \\npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \\neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \\nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \\nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \\npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \\ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \\nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \\nalready out there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \\nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \\ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \\nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \\nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \\nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \\nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \\ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \\ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \\nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \\nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \\naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \\nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \\nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \\ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \\none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \\nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \\ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \\nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \\nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \\nstrategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \\nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \\nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \\ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \\nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \\neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \\ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \\ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \\nskills for on-the-job learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \\nalready being done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \\npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \\ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \\nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \\nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \\nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \\ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \\nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \\ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \\nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \\nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \\nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \\nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \\ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \\ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \\nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \\nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \\nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \\ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \\ncoming forth before too long.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \\nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \\nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \\na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \\nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \\nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \\ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \\nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \\ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \\nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \\ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \\nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \\ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \\nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \\nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \\ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \\nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \\nlife-long learning in this country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \\nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \\nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \\nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \\nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \\nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \\nthat we need to meet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \\nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \\nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \\nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \\npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \\nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \\nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \\nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \\nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \\nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \\ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \\nI wonder if you would comment on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \\nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \\ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \\nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \\nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \\nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \\nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \\nfor jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \\ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \\ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \\ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \\nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \\ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \\nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \\nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \\nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \\ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \\nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \\nTodd of Austin, Texas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \\nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \\nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \\nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \\nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \\nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \\nvery supportive.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \\nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \\nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \\nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \\nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \\nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \\nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \\nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \\nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \\nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \\nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \\nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \\nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \\nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \\nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \\nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \\nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \\nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \\ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \\nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \\nworking on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \\nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \\nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \\ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \\nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \\nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \\nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \\ntrained on a year-round basis.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \\na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \\nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \\nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \\nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \\nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \\nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \\ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \\nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \\nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \\nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \\nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \\nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \\naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \\njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \\nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \\neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \\nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \\nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \\nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \\ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \\nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \\nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \\nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \\nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \\nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \\ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \\nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \\nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \\nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \\nmoving.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Doctor?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \\nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \\nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \\nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \\nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \\nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \\nextremely effective learning strategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \\nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \\nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \\npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \\nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \\nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \\nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \\ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \\nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \\ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \\ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \\nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \\nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \\nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \\nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \\nthem and we can discuss it later.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \\nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \\nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \\npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \\nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \\nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \\nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \\nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \\nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \\nvocational program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \\nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \\nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \\nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \\nstudents that needs them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \\nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \\nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \\n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \\nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \\nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \\ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \\ncareer directions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \\ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \\ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \\nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \\nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \\nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \\n\\n                                 END9:00 P.M. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\n\"]\n",

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \\nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \\npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \\nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \\nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \\nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \\nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \\nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \\nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \\nsystem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \\nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \\nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \\nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \\nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \\ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \\nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \\nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \\nalso.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \\nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \\nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \\nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \\nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \\nat this time.  It's great to have you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \\nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \\nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \\nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \\ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \\nfrom school to the work place.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \\nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \\neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \\nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \\nmake things happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \\nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \\nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \\nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \\nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \\nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \\nthe rest of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \\nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \\nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \\nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \\neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \\nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \\nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \\nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \\ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \\nwith changing times.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \\nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \\ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \\nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \\ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \\nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \\nlong run.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \\nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \\nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \\nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \\nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \\nlearn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \\nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \\nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \\nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \\ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \\nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \\nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \\ncan be learning and working at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \\nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \\ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \\ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \\ncan prepare students for this world of work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \\nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \\nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \\nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \\nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \\njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \\nareas of the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \\nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \\nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \\nwords is that so important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \\nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \\nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \\nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \\ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \\nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \\nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \\nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \\nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \\ntaught before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \\nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \\nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \\nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \\nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \\ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \\nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \\ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \\ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \\nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \\neducational component of training.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \\nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \\nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \\neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \\nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \\ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \\nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \\napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \\nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \\neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \\nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \\nyoung people even beyond the summer.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \\nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \\nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \\ndeveloping.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \\nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \\nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \\nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \\nget in a high school diploma.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \\nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \\neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \\npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \\ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \\nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \\nemployers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \\ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \\nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \\ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \\nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \\nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \\nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \\nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \\na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \\nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \\nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \\nthe earnings of American workers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \\nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \\npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \\neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \\nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \\nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \\npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \\ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \\nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \\nalready out there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \\nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \\ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \\nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \\nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \\nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \\nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \\ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \\ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \\nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \\nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \\naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \\nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \\nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \\ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \\none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \\nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \\ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \\nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \\nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \\nstrategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \\nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \\nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \\ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \\nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \\neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \\ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \\ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \\nskills for on-the-job learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \\nalready being done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \\npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \\ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \\nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \\nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \\nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \\ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \\nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \\ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \\nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \\nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \\nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \\nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \\ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \\ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \\nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \\nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \\nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \\ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \\ncoming forth before too long.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \\nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \\nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \\na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \\nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \\nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \\ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \\nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \\ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \\nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \\ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \\nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \\ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \\nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \\nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \\ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \\nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \\nlife-long learning in this country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \\nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \\nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \\nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \\nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \\nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \\nthat we need to meet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \\nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \\nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \\nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \\npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \\nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \\nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \\nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \\nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \\nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \\ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \\nI wonder if you would comment on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \\nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \\ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \\nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \\nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \\nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \\nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \\nfor jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \\ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \\ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \\ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \\nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \\ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \\nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \\nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \\nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \\ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \\nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \\nTodd of Austin, Texas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \\nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \\nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \\nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \\nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \\nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \\nvery supportive.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \\nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \\nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \\nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \\nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \\nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \\nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \\nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \\nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \\nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \\nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \\nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \\nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \\nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \\nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \\nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \\nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \\nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \\ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \\nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \\nworking on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \\nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \\nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \\ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \\nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \\nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \\nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \\ntrained on a year-round basis.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \\na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \\nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \\nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \\nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \\nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \\nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \\ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \\nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \\nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \\nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \\nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \\nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \\naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \\njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \\nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \\neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \\nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \\nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \\nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \\ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \\nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \\nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \\nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \\nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \\nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \\ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \\nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \\nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \\nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \\nmoving.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Doctor?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \\nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \\nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \\nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \\nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \\nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \\nextremely effective learning strategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \\nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \\nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \\npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \\nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \\nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \\nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \\ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \\nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \\ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \\ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \\nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \\nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \\nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \\nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \\nthem and we can discuss it later.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \\nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \\nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \\npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \\nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \\nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \\nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \\nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \\nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \\nvocational program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \\nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \\nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \\nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \\nstudents that needs them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \\nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \\nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \\n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \\nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \\nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \\ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \\ncareer directions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \\ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \\ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \\nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \\nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \\nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \\n\\n                                 END9:00 P.M. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\n\"],\n",
